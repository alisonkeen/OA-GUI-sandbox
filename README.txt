THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL FORK!!

In the interests of giving credit where credit is due, I have (tried to?) create a separate repository to play with, but the commit trail is intact. 

This does NOT mean that past contributors approve or support this! 

I am learning Ruby, Rails and PHP on the fly and desperately want an SA version of OpenAustralia.org.  This may never happen, however I am hoping to create a private version that works for personal use, and the source code is public in case it helps any official efforts... or it may just end up being a borked mess, who knows. 

In any case if I have broken etiquette somewhere please tell me - it probably wasn't intentional!

Best wishes

Alison

Hello everyone,

We're pleased to release the TheyWorkForYou.com source code.  This is the code
for the website itself.  It's mainly written in PHP, although there are also
some Perl scripts for database loading and indexing.  The backend parser code
is separate and available from the Public Whip CVS repository on sourceforge.

The TheyWorkForYou.com source code in this distribution is released under a BSD
style license.   Roughly, this means you are free to copy, use, modify and
redistribute the code or binaries made from the code.  Commercial or
non-commercial use is allowed.  However, we disclaim warranty, and expect you
not to use our name without our permission.

See the file LICENSE.txt for exact legal information.

What is TheyWorkForYou.com anyway?

Everything MPs say in the UK's House of Commons is recorded in a document
called Hansard.  TheyWorkForYou.com helps make sense of this vital democratic
resource and, crucially, allows you to add your own comments and links to the
official transcripts of Parliament.

How on earth do I use this code?

Probably best that you ask on the publicwhip-playing email list.
